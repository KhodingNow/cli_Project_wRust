'Now ladies and getleman, here is one you can all sing to'
When the Saints go marching'
'Come on folks, everybody sing'
Now when the Saints go marching in, Yes I want to be in that number'

'Sing it again, when the SAints go marchin in, yes I want to be in that number'
'Ohh , beautiful audience out there swinging with us...'
- Louis Armstrong and Band
